        "Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Bring a large pan of lightly salted water to the boil. Cut the potatoes into chunky wedges, then boil in the water for 7 mins. Drain and leave to steam dry for 5 mins.",
        "Spread the wedges out on a large baking sheet or two smaller ones. Toss with the oil and 1 tsp salt (preferably sea salt) and spread out so that they arenâ€™t overlapping. Roast for 30 mins, turning halfway until golden and crisp.."
