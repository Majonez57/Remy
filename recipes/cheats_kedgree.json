  "steps": [
    "Preheat the oven to gas 4, 180°C, fan 160°C. Loosely wrap each fillet in lightly oiled foil, then bake for 15 mins or until warmed through. Meanwhile, boil your eggs for 7 mins; transfer to a bowl of cold water. Peel under cold running water and set aside.",
    "Cook the rice to pack instructions. Heat 1 tbsp vegetable oil in a large, lidded frying pan over a medium-low heat and fry spring onions for 2 mins until softened.",
    "Add 1 tbsp medium curry powder and cook for 1 min, stirring, until fragrant. Gently stir in the rice, flake through the haddock and cook for 1-2 mins more until the flavours have combined. Remove from the heat. Halve the eggs, place on top of the rice mix, cover and set aside for 1 min. Season with black pepper and scatter with another 2 sliced spring onions to serve."
