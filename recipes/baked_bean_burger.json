  "steps": [
    "Heat 1 tbsp oil in a frying pan over a low heat and fry the onion for 5 mins. Stir in the dried herbs and chillies (if using) and cook for 2 mins. Transfer to a bowl and add the beans, breadcrumbs, potato and parsley. Mix well, then lightly dampen your hands and shape the mixture into 4 equal patties. Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper and chill in the fridge for 10 mins.",
    "Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C and line a baking sheet with nonstick baking paper. Transfer the burgers to the sheet, brush with the remaining oil and bake for 20 mins or until piping hot.",
    "Top each burger with cheese; return to the oven for 3 mins or until melted. Serve in the rolls with the pickle, lettuce and tomato, and chips alongside, if you like."
